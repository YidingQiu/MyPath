## We are solving:


### Using AI to Help Australians Navigate Government Services
MyPath directly answers this brief by turning life events into clear, explainable steps you can accept in one tap. We chose this challenge because people struggle with scattered rules, confusing eligibility and channel friction at critical moments. Our method uses a data-driven relevancy engine to assemble eligibility confidence, dollar estimates, best-appointment suggestions and ordered checklists—each with source and timestamp. The design is mobile-first, plain-language, privacy-preserving (“claims, not copies”) and includes Safe Mode for crises. Demos include Income Shock and Bushfire Relief (immediate → recovery) to prove faster access and successful completion.
### Navigating Australia’s Data Landscape
We entered this challenge to show that better services start with better data plumbing. MyPath implements an automated discovery→fit-scoring→integration pipeline that evaluates datasets for officialness, freshness, licence, coverage and ASGS join quality, then emits explainable artefacts the UI uses directly. A built-in Relevancy Report exposes why a given source was preferred (and when it was last updated). This approach is portable across domains—civics, disaster, SME compliance—and demonstrates a scalable, transparent pattern for agencies and councils to rely on, not a hand-curated link farm.
### Data-Driven Reduction in Gambling Harm
We chose this challenge to reduce harm without profiling individuals. MyPath applies area-level, open-data indicators to gently prioritise support options (counselling, self-exclusion, transport) and temporarily down-rank venue-style prompts during higher-risk windows—always with visible provenance and user choice. The experience is light-touch and respectful; users see helpful options when relevant, not labels about them. Our method is transparent (Relevancy Report), privacy-first, and compatible with community partnerships. A detailed analysis case study will be included to show the indicator construction and measurable uplift.
### Connecting New Citizens to Australian Democracy
We selected this challenge to turn ceremony into real belonging and practical participation. MyPath recognises the “New Citizen” moment and assembles a first-week plan (enrolment, representatives, secure myGov, passport, English learning) plus a 90-day plan (volunteering, local events, petitions/submissions) with official sources and plain language. The design emphasises hands-on civic education in everyday actions, not lectures. Our data relevancy engine keeps electorate info, contacts, and civics resources fresh and place-accurate, while the one-tap plan converts intent into achievable tasks that build confidence and trust.
### Red Tape Navigator
We entered to help SMEs cut through overlapping Commonwealth–State–Local rules. MyPath constructs an obligation map (dependencies, duplicates, conflicts) from open sources, then renders a human-friendly plan: bundled prerequisites, optimal order, renewals calendar and deep links to lodge. The UI shows a clear graph for transparency, supports de-confliction with citations, and lets owners Accept Compliance Plan to create trackable tasks with definitions of done. Our relevancy pipeline ensures we use the freshest, most authoritative data, making compliance faster, clearer and less error-prone for small businesses.

(Note for Data-Driven Reduction in Gambling Harm)

For this challenge, see "Datasets used.zip" for the (modified) datasets from data.vic.gov.au, see 'Analysis.zip' for the plots and the script used to generate them, and see 'Analysis of gambling data.pdf' for an analysis of the data that identifies risk factors and communities, proposes some interventions for youth protection and some community-level solutions that reduce likelihood of harm from gambling and strengthen social connection.
