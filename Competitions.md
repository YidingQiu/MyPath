Solving problems before they become problems



####

How might we demonstrate that a powerful new Constructive Modelling Paradigm and Framework for multi-disciplinary discovery can help people solve problems more effectively?

The AXiLe® Constructive Modelling Paradigm is a knowledge integration system that makes it faster and easier for people to find and use information to make evidence-driven decisions across many domains. Three core components of this Paradigm are:
1. A consistent way of mapping between different knowledge domains – the SmartMatter Framework®.
2. An Open Knowledge Reference Model (OKRM) that anchors a library of Open Reference Patterns (ORP) and can be used to benchmark the performance of any conceptual model in the global knowledgebase.
3. The AXiLe® Natural Pattern Language – a controlled vocabulary of brevity codes that can be used to align any domain-specific ontology.
These foundational components can help build the risk-aware critical thinking and problem-solving skills needed to achieve global sustainability. The capability system for delivering ongoing sustainability is envisaged as a person-centric Worldwide Mosaic Web where everyone is empowered by easier access to better-organised information.

In this unprecedented moonshot project, risk management is key. But every risk management strategy must begin with a risk identification step that is limited by pre-existing knowledge and discoveries. This step can act as a constraining factor – hampering the end-to-end and cross-domain systems thinking needed to ask better-informed questions. All too often the end-result is some kind of tangible harm, such as the failure of many government-sponsored projects and innovation initiatives.

One way to surface risks on complex projects is to integrate regular “premortem” events into the project risk management strategy. At these meetings, the project is assumed to have already failed, and the attendees must ask “Why did this happen?”. The strength of the approach lies in the power of human imagination focused by the retrospective context of the question.
As part of this challenge, you are requested to perform a minimum of two premortems – the first on the Design for the Mosaic Web Initiative, and the second on a GovHack-appropriate project of your own choice.

You should deliver a separate premortem report package for each project, and a summary report package that captures shared themes, differentiating factors, and ideas for broader-based improvements (these may include ideas based on actual problems that your team encountered during your GovHack 2025 project).
The goals of this Challenge are:
1. To encourage people to consider ongoing proactive risk management
2. To obtain feedback about the Modelling Paradigm that will help set the direction of future research and development work
3. To solidify one or more real-world use cases that can serve as demonstrations of concept.

Please follow the link to the document repository to learn more about the Modelling Paradigm and the Mosaic Web Design. There are documents to study, tips for planning your work, some quickstart ideas just in case you need inspiration, and templated guidance for the requested deliverables.
Please see the Challenge video for an example of premortem storytelling.

**Eligibility:** Open to everyone. Submissions should use at least one government data source.

**Entry:** Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia.

# Data-Driven Reduction in Gambling Harm for Stronger Community Resilience

## Jurisdiction: Victoria

#Protecting-communities-from-gambling-harm



####

How might we use public data to understand and reduce gambling harm in our communities — from protecting young people online to identifying at-risk neighbourhoods and addressing the long-term impacts on families and social connection?

Gambling creates significant challenges for community wellbeing, particularly in disadvantaged areas where electronic gaming machine (EGM) density is highest and gambling harm impacts are most severe. Areas with high EGM spending often correlate with increased crime, family violence, and mental health issues. In addition, access and exposure to online gambling, especially for under-18s, is increasingly being enabled by online platforms, video games, and social media.
At a broader community level, electronic gaming machines, socio-economic stress, and chronic gambling behaviour cause long-lasting impacts on wellbeing, finances, and social cohesion.

Victoria collects extensive data across multiple agencies that could be leveraged to better understand and prevent gambling harm, some of which is listed below. Yet this data can be siloed, preventing comprehensive understanding of gambling harm patterns and limiting the effectiveness of prevention strategies.

Your challenge is to use datasets including EGM activity, crime and health statistics, socio-economic indicators, and digital engagement metrics to: 
- Identify risk factors and at-risk communities 
- Design interventions for youth protection 
- Propose community-level solutions that foster resilience, reduce harm, and
strengthen social connection

**Eligibility:** Open to all, but preference given to teams with a lead in VIC. At least one dataset from data.vic.gov.au must be used. Your proposal must clearly address the challenge.

**Entry:** Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia.

# An Accurate and Trustworthy Chatbot for Data Interactions
## Jurisdiction: Northern Territory

Ask your data, trust the answer



####

How can government agencies deploy conversational and analytical AI to interrogate complex datasets while maintaining the high degree of accuracy and auditability standards required for official decision-making?

Government agencies manage thousands of datasets but lack intuitive ways to extract insights. While AI chatbots show promise, government's accuracy requirements (where 90% isn't sufficient) create unique challenges around trust, vetting, and accountability.
Currently, there is a heavy focus on more advanced AI and LLM frameworks and architectures that possess increased logical and reasoning skills, such as the recent release of ChatGPT5 that promises ‘PhD-level’ intelligence. However, a known drawback of such advances in reasoning is hallucination, where the model openly provides inaccurate information or sources that must be questioned by the user.
Instead, government solutions and the ongoing uptake of AI in Government requires the opposite set of criteria, where accuracy is paramount whilst the reasoning capabilities of models are less critical and can instead be user-driven. As such, there is a pressing need to develop tools, approaches and solutions to focus on this balance instead.

Your solution should demonstrate or focus on at least one of the following:
- Conversational data interrogation across multiple government datasets
- Trust scoring and vetting mechanisms that validate AI responses
- Grounded, scope-limited responses (no hallucinations about unrelated topics)
- Transferable framework that works across departments (HR, finance, operations)
- Suggested question scaffolding to guide users toward productive queries
- Audit trails showing how conclusions were reached

Some example use cases by users of your solution could be the following questions:
- Finance: "Am I going to meet my budget this year?" "Show me vendor payment outliers"
- HR: "What's happening with leave patterns in my team?"
- Operations: "Are there any red flags in our procurement data?"

Data integration: Teams must use at least one large scale dataset, either from Government or from third party sites and demonstrate the accuracy of their solution in some manner.
Ethical AI: All AI proposals must demonstrate commitment to ethical AI practices, including considerations for privacy, bias prevention, and transparency in algorithmic decision-making.

**Eligibility:** Open to all, but special consideration will exist for teams with a local NT lead.

**Entry:** Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia.

#  Closing the Gap on Indigenous Outcomes
## Jurisdiction: Australia

#Indigenous_outcomes #Data_equity



####

How can we develop new ways of analysing Closing the Gap and government datasets to identify patterns and inform targeted interventions that accelerate progress toward equity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples?

The 2025 Annual Data Compilation Report ([https://www.pc.gov.au/closing-the-gap-data/annual-data-report/closing-the-gap-annual-data-compilation-july2025.pdf](https://www.pc.gov.au/closing-the-gap-data/annual-data-report/closing-the-gap-annual-data-compilation-july2025.pdf)) reveals a sobering reality: only 4 of 19 Closing the Gap targets are on track to be met, with outcomes actually worsening in four critical areas including adult imprisonment, children in out-of-home care, suicide rates, and children's developmental progress. Despite decades of effort and billions in investment, the gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians persists across health, education, employment, and justice outcomes.
The National Agreement on Closing the Gap, developed in genuine partnership between Australian governments and the Coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peak Organisations, represents an unprecedented shift toward Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people determining, driving, and owning desired outcomes. However, the 2025 data shows that while some targets like preschool enrollment and land rights are improving, fundamental challenges remain.
Life expectancy gaps persist, with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men living 71.9 years and women 75.6 years - not on track to close by 2031. Tragically, suicide remains the leading cause of death for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15-39. Meanwhile, promising areas like healthy birthweights (89.6% in 2021) show that progress is achievable when the right conditions are met.
The challenge lies in the complexity of interconnected outcomes and the need for evidence-based, culturally appropriate interventions. Current data gaps prevent full assessment of progress, and governments have yet to agree on approaches to measure the four Priority Reforms that are key to achieving targets. There's an urgent need for analysis that can identify patterns across many vast datasets, predict intervention outcomes, and inform targeted strategies that respect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander data sovereignty principles.

High-Level Questions:
- Pattern Recognition Across Outcomes: Using Closing the Gap dashboard data, what patterns and new insights can be identified that point to opportunities where interventions could have multiplier effects?
- Are there specific types of analyses that would reveal novel insights, such as interconnected datasets, identifying communities or regions experiencing better outcomes, or using historical data?
- Priority Reform Implementation: How can government data reveal where the four Priority Reforms (shared decision-making, building Aboriginal Community Controlled sector, data sharing, transforming government institutions) are being effectively implemented and their correlation with improved outcomes?
- Digital Equity: How can use data or tools to ensure that a gap in digital and AI access and knowledge doesn’t accumulate and add to disparities in outcomes? Are we ensuring that cultural practices are respected when it comes to data and digital knowledge?

You are expected to:
- Use at least one Closing the Gap dataset or related government data to develop insights. Specify at least one Closing the Gap target that your analysis or solution genuinely addresses.
- Develop solutions that could be easily deployed or used by government agencies, Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations, or other stakeholders working toward Closing the Gap objectives, without needing a considerable amount of further analysis or wrangling.

**Eligibility:** Open to all. Proposals should demonstrate clear potential to improve outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.

**Entry:** Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia.

# Connecting New Citizens to Australian Democracy
## Jurisdiction: Australia

#Democracy-in-practice



####

How might we design new ways to strengthen sense of belonging, civic knowledge and community connection for people engaging with democratic systems and services for the first time?

Becoming an Australian citizen is a significant milestone, but the journey of belonging, connection and participation continues well beyond the ceremony. In the years after citizenship, new Australians often face challenges in fully engaging and integrating in their communities, building social connections and navigating democratic systems and the practices of civic life.
Recent research from the Resilient Democracy Research and Data Network ([https://australiandemocraticresilience.substack.com/p/introducing-the-australian-resilient](https://australiandemocraticresilience.substack.com/p/introducing-the-australian-resilient)) shows declining rates of civic participation and volunteering in Australia over the past three decades. Both experiential and classroom-based civic education are crucial, yet most programs don’t continue beyond the schooling years, leaving new Australians with limited opportunities to gain practical civic knowledge beyond the citizenship test.

This challenge is your chance to identify the gaps that exist in the current offering and design innovative, practical solutions that empower new Australians to:
- Experience hands-on civic education and learn how Australian democracy works in real life
- Navigate and access public services with confidence, including through engagement with their elected representatives
- Get involved in local events and discover opportunities to engage with community including through volunteering
- Grow their understanding of civic rights and responsibilities and how to leverage these to benefit their community
- Connect with others and participate in community decision-making, both online and in person
Bring your creativity and passion to our challenge and help shape a future where every person feels valued and empowered to contribute. Let’s build a more resilient, vibrant Australia—starting now!

This GovHack challenge is seeking to identify practical, innovative and scalable solutions that help new Australians:
- Build a deeper sense of belonging and connection to Australian society and its diverse communities
- Strengthen civic knowledge and confidence in understanding rights, responsibilities and democratic processes
- Enhance opportunities for active participation, volunteering and contributions to communities, and
- Improve satisfaction and trust in Australian democracy and democratic institutions
We welcome creative ideas that could take the form of digital tools, social innovations, community-driven approaches or cross-sector partnerships, incorporating government data. The best solutions will be those that, are inclusive, practical to implement and capable of making a real-world difference at scale.

**Eligibility:** Open to all. Submissions should use at least one government data source.

**Entry:** Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia.

# Navigating Australia’s Data Landscape
## Jurisdiction: Australia



####

Can you connect data users with the right data to answer their questions?

Government data is increasingly being viewed as a national asset. However, government departments independently manage their own assets and the data landscape can be fragmented and hard to navigate for researchers and policy makers.
Finding the right data to answer policy and research questions often means a lot of legwork and trial and error to make sense of what is available. In many cases, data users “don’t know what they don’t know” – if only there was a solution to help data consumers find the most appropriate data source(s) to meet their needs, and unmask new links with other datasets they’d never thought of?

The ABS is the Australia’s national statistics office and compiles statistics that inform critical decisions across government, businesses and communities. From real-time economic indicators to the nationwide Census, ABS data forms part of a formidable evidence base for decision making across a nation of 27 million people.
In addition to the ABS, data is regularly published by other federal departments, and at the state and local council levels. Whilst this data forms a rich treasure trove of information, the volume and disparate host sites for such information can mean data gets overlooked or underutilised and that information siloes can inadvertently be created.
To bridge this, the ABS is looking for an approach or prototype for creating a searchable "national inventory" of publicly available data that can help users make sense of what is available. You should consider:
- A description of available data assets – what’s in the data? When was it collected? For what purpose? Are their department-specific catalogues already available? Is metadata available?
- Is the data readily available or does it need to be requested? Who is the data custodian?
- How do you get the data? Can it be downloaded? Is there an API?
- How are data sets related to one another? Are they part of series? Is one dataset used to create another?

Your task is to develop a single interface or solution that helps users navigate this environment by dynamically understanding data available from across government. The solution should be explainable and scalable. You should consider the user experience and how they can get what they need using natural language and/or intuitive searching.

In developing an initial solution, consider the ABS and at least two other agencies with significant data holdings, and how the solution creates a simple view across their combined data holdings. Bonus points if you include data from the ABS DATA API, for more information on how to find/use the data, check our User guide: [https://www.abs.gov.au/about/data-services/data-explorer/data-explorer-user-guide](https://www.abs.gov.au/about/data-services/data-explorer/data-explorer-user-guide)

**Eligibility:** Open to contestants from any State. At least one dataset from the ABS must be used.

**Entry:** Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia.

# Using AI to Help Australians Navigate Government Services
## Jurisdiction: Australia

#Smarter-services



####

How might we use AI to make it easier for people to access, understand and engage with the government services and supports they need - when they need them?

From birth of a child to job loss, to becoming a carer - people interact with government services during some of life’s most critical moments. But navigating the complexity of supports, eligibility rules and information sources can be confusing and fragmented.
Key information is scattered across many different sources, requiring individuals to have the skills and means to search for, make sense of, and access the right support. For many, this journey can be confusing and overwhelming, leaving them feeling powerless.
For example, people go through major planned or unplanned ‘life events’, such as birth of a child or recovering from a natural disaster, which require interactions with government services provided by different agencies or tiers of government.

This challenge invites participants to explore how generative AI can improve government services - making them more accessible, intuitive, and responsive to the needs of the public.

‘Better services’ might mean more inclusive design, life-event-based support, faster support, seamless navigation between agencies, or smarter mobile friendly tools that support digital self-service. Participants are encouraged to think about government services broadly - think big, challenge assumptions, and design with empathy.

Please note the example datasets are a starting point – you are welcome to incorporate other data sources.

Bonus points for ideas that are consistent with the AI Technical Standards design statements (see [https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/AI-technical-standard/technical-standard-governments-use-artificial-intelligence-design](https://www.digital.gov.au/policy/ai/AI-technical-standard/technical-standard-governments-use-artificial-intelligence-design)).

# An Accurate and Trustworthy Chatbot for Data Interactions


## Jurisdiction: Northern Territory

Ask your data, trust the answer



####

How can government agencies deploy conversational and analytical AI to interrogate complex datasets while maintaining the high degree of accuracy and auditability standards required for official decision-making?

Government agencies manage thousands of datasets but lack intuitive ways to extract insights. While AI chatbots show promise, government's accuracy requirements (where 90% isn't sufficient) create unique challenges around trust, vetting, and accountability.
Currently, there is a heavy focus on more advanced AI and LLM frameworks and architectures that possess increased logical and reasoning skills, such as the recent release of ChatGPT5 that promises ‘PhD-level’ intelligence. However, a known drawback of such advances in reasoning is hallucination, where the model openly provides inaccurate information or sources that must be questioned by the user.
Instead, government solutions and the ongoing uptake of AI in Government requires the opposite set of criteria, where accuracy is paramount whilst the reasoning capabilities of models are less critical and can instead be user-driven. As such, there is a pressing need to develop tools, approaches and solutions to focus on this balance instead.

Your solution should demonstrate or focus on at least one of the following:
- Conversational data interrogation across multiple government datasets
- Trust scoring and vetting mechanisms that validate AI responses
- Grounded, scope-limited responses (no hallucinations about unrelated topics)
- Transferable framework that works across departments (HR, finance, operations)
- Suggested question scaffolding to guide users toward productive queries
- Audit trails showing how conclusions were reached

Some example use cases by users of your solution could be the following questions:
- Finance: "Am I going to meet my budget this year?" "Show me vendor payment outliers"
- HR: "What's happening with leave patterns in my team?"
- Operations: "Are there any red flags in our procurement data?"

Data integration: Teams must use at least one large scale dataset, either from Government or from third party sites and demonstrate the accuracy of their solution in some manner.
Ethical AI: All AI proposals must demonstrate commitment to ethical AI practices, including considerations for privacy, bias prevention, and transparency in algorithmic decision-making.

**Eligibility:** Open to all, but special consideration will exist for teams with a local NT lead.

**Entry:** Challenge entry is available to all teams in Australia.
